# Recursion

RECURSION: PYTHON
Recursive Data Structures
Data structures can also be recursive.

Trees are a recursive data structure because their definition is self-referential. A tree is a data structure which contains a piece of data and references to other trees!

Trees which are referenced by other trees are known as children. Trees which hold references to other trees are known as the parents.

A tree can be both parent and child. We’re going to write a recursive function that builds a special type of tree: a binary search tree.

Binary search trees:

Reference two children at most per tree node.
The “left” child of the tree must contain a value lesser than its parent
The “right” child of the tree must contain a value greater than its parent.
Trees are an abstract data type, meaning we can implement our version in a number of ways as long as we follow the rules above.

For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll use the humble Python dictionary:

bst_tree_node = {"data": 42}
bst_tree_node["left_child"] = {"data": 36}
bst_tree_node["right_child"] = {"data": 73}
 
bst_tree_node["data"] > bst_tree_node["left_child"]["data"]
# True
bst_tree_node["data"] < bst_tree_node["right_child"]["data"]
# True
We can also assume our function will receive a sorted list of values as input.

This is necessary to construct the binary search tree because we’ll be relying on the ordering of the list input.

Our high-level strategy before moving through the checkpoints.

base case: the input list is empty
Return "No Child" to represent the lack of node
recursive step: the input list must be divided into two halves
Find the middle index of the list
Store the value located at the middle index
Make a tree node with a "data" key set to the value
Assign tree node’s "left child" to a recursive call using the left half of the list
Assign tree node’s "right child" to a recursive call using the right half of the list
Return the tree node
Instructions
1.
Define the build_bst() function with my_list as the sole parameter.

If my_list has no elements, return “No Child” to represent the lack of a child tree node.

This is the base case of our function.

The recursive step will need to remove an element from the input to eventually reach an empty list.

We’ll be building this tree by dividing the list in half and feeding those halves to the left and right sides of the tree.

This dividing step will eventually produce empty lists to satisfy the base case of the function.

Outside of the conditional you just wrote, declare middle_idx and set it to the middle index of my_list.

Then, declare middle_value and set it to the value in my_list located at middle_idx.

Print “Middle index: “ + middle_idx.

Then, print “Middle value: “ + middle_value

You can use .format() or addition for the print the statement. Addition will require you to use str() on the variables since they are integers!

After the print statements, declare the variable tree_node that points to a Python dictionary with a key of "data" pointing to middle_value.

tree_node represents the tree being created in this function call. We want a tree_node created for each element in the list, so we’ll repeat this process on the left and right sub-trees using the appropriate half of the input list.

Now for the recursive calls!

Set the key of "left_child" in tree_node to be a recursive call to build_bst() with the left half of the list not including the middle value as an argument.

Set the key of "right_child" in tree_node to be a recursive call to build_bst() with the right half of the list not including the middle value as an argument.

It’s very important we don’t include the middle_value in the lists we’re passing as arguments, or else we’ll create duplicate nodes!

Finally, return tree_node. As the recursive calls resolve and pop off the call stack, the final return value will be the root or “top” tree_node which contains a reference to every other tree_node.

Congratulations! You’ve built up a recursive data structure with a recursive function!

This data structure can be used to find values in an efficient O(logN) time.

Fill in the variable runtime with the runtime of your build_bst() function.

This runtime is a tricky one so don’t be afraid to use that hint!
